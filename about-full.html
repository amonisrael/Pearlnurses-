        <h1>Our Story: The Heart Behind PearlNurses</h1>
        
        <p>PearlNurses started with a simple observation in the wards: <strong>Ugandan nurses are the most resilient professionals in the world, yet they are often the most underserved.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            "We saw students struggling to find clinical guides that matched local equipment. We saw nurses carrying the weight of the system alone. We decided to build a digital home for them."
        </div>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>In every hospital, from the heart of Kampala to the quietest Health Center II, there is a nurse making life-changing decisions. Our mission is built on three pillars:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Localized Knowledge:</strong> Textbooks are global, but challenges are local.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Mentorship:</strong> A mentor available 24/7 for every student.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Elevation:</strong> Better resources lead to better patient outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>PearlNurses is a growing movement dedicated to <strong>"Service with Love and Knowledge."</strong> We believe that when a nurse is well-informed, the entire nation heals.</p>
